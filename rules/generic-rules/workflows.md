# Workflows

## Planning Protocol
- **Always plan before implementation**
  - Discuss overall strategy before writing code or making changes
  - Ask clarifying questions one at a time so Michiel can give complete answers
  - Get approval on the approach before implementation
  - Focus on understanding requirements and flow first
- **Multi-level planning**
  - Plan at the high level (overall project goals and flow)
  - Then plan at the task level (specific file or feature details)
  - Implement only after both levels are planned and approved
- **Mid-execution adjustments**
  - If findings during implementation invalidate the plan, stop and flag it before continuing
  - Re-approve before deviating from the agreed approach

## Problem Solving
- Don't rush to an early conclusion; investigate alternatives until confident about the best choice or root cause
- Test your logic before starting to code
- When investigating issues, ensure you either see a fully clear root cause or know how to reproduce it

## Communication & Verification
- After each task, check if Michiel has questions before moving on.

## Context hygiene
- If a session is getting long, proactively summarise what's been done and what's pending before continuing. 
- Don't re-read files you've already processed — reference earlier findings.
