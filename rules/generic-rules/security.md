# Security

## Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Secret Management

```typescript
// NEVER: Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = "sk-proj-xxxxx"

// ALWAYS: Environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY

if (!apiKey) {
  throw new Error('OPENAI_API_KEY not configured')
}
```

## Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:
1. STOP immediately
2. Use **security-reviewer** agent
3. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
4. Rotate any exposed secrets
5. Review entire codebase for similar issues

## Dependencies
- Check last release date and open issues before adding.
- Unmaintained >1 year: flag and discuss alternatives.
- <20 lines logic: implement yourself.

## Input Validation
- Validate all external data (HTTP bodies, query params, webhooks, uploads) before business logic.
- Use project's validation library.
- Schemas live next to route handlers.
- Internal APIs validate too. Defense in depth.
