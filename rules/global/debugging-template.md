## BLOCKING REQUIREMENT: Systematic Debugging

**Before proposing any fix for bugs, test failures, or unexpected behavior:** Invoke `Skill(superpowers:systematic-debugging)`. No exceptions.

**Blocked rationalizations:**
- "The fix is obvious"
- "I already know the root cause"
- "Quick one-liner"

**Process:** Verify root cause with evidence → confirm theory → implement fix. Evidence before code, always.
