# Michiel's Global Claude Code Preferences

## How Michiel and Claude Work Together

**Writing Convention for CLAUDE.md Files:**
- Always use "Michiel" (or "the human") and "Claude" instead of pronouns
- Never use "I", "you", "me", "my", "your" in CLAUDE.md files
- This avoids ambiguity about who "I" or "you" refers to
- Example: "Michiel writes, Claude edits" (not "I write, you edit")
