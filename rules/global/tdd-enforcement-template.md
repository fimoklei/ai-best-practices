## BLOCKING REQUIREMENT: Test-Driven Development

**Before Edit/Write for features, bugs, or refactoring:** Invoke `Skill(superpowers:test-driven-development)`. No exceptions.

**Blocked rationalizations:**
- "Too simple" / "Low risk" / "Single file"
- "Plan says implement directly"
- "Tests after"

**Exception:** Documentation-only (no code affected)

**Process:** RED → GREEN → REFACTOR. Tests first, always.
